## Challenges & Struggles
 - I struggled with aligning objects to the center, managing their size and how much they would stretch or not according to the viewport.
  - I takes me some time to realize how to mix absolute, fixed, relative and other positions in combination with the grid and flex-box layout.

## Questions
 - When I created a <div> with `width : 100%` , it worked perfectly. However when I introduced the `vertical : 100%` parameter the <div> would no appear. Why does this happen?
  - Which is a better way to handle the layout, through grids or through flex-box?
  - When organizaing content in a webpage, what should be left to JS and what should be controlled with CSS?
